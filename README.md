The program does not allow with 3 digits and even greater than 60. When this occurs, the program asks the user to type a again. After the user, enter the program that shows the user-defined numbers and as chosen as two and the compared ones that exist in common. If there is no common number, the program will show a 'not this time' message. For each number within the two lists, the common program informs the amount of numbers determined in the draw and one of 4 determined, will be informed if you won a quarter, a corner a sena.
